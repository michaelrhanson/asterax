Some have returned with wealth beyond the wildest dreams of man, woman, or small fuzzy creature from Alpha Centauri, retiring to a life of luxury and exotic frozen drinks.  Most, of course, have simply died brief but heinous deaths.\r\rYou, of course, being a brave but currently poor pilot, do not plan to die one of the aforementioned deaths.\r\rAlone, or with a single companion, you will enter the asteroid belt to blast the precious emeraldium loose from the rocks where it hides.  You will also uncover rare elements that provide energy to sustain your ship.  If you are successful and gather the delicate crystals, you will be able to trade them for better equipment and eternal fame.\r\rOf course, you are not the only pilots in the belts of Arvis Omega!  Aliens from far-off worlds come there as well, to gather the crystals for themselves, or just to blow away some annoying humans. \r\rGood luck!\u0000"

Its slender body contains both powerful thrusters and swift maneuvering jets.  It carries relatively weak weapons, however.\r\rThe Moth is a time-honored favorite, containing a mix of decent weaponry and reasonable engines.
